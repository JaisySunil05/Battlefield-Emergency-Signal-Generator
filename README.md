# Battlefield Emergency Signal Generator

## Overview
This project presents a **Battlefield Emergency Signal Generator** designed using
**discrete electronic components only**, without microcontrollers or ICs.

It is intended for use in:
- Battlefield emergencies
- Disaster rescue operations
- Communication-denied environments

## Key Features
- No microcontroller / software dependency
- Works under harsh conditions
- Simple, rugged, and reliable design
- Low power consumption

## Circuit Description
The circuit is based on:
- Multivibrator / oscillator principle
- Transistor-based switching
- RC timing network for frequency control

## Components Used
- NPN Transistors
- Resistors
- Capacitors
- Buzzer / Speaker
- Battery supply

## Working Principle
This system detects 𝐟𝐢𝐫𝐞, 𝐦𝐨𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧, 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐠𝐚𝐬 through sensors.
Each condition activates a 𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐧𝐬𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐫-𝐛𝐚𝐬𝐞𝐝 𝐚𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐛𝐥𝐞 𝐦𝐮𝐥𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐢𝐛𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐨𝐫 𝐠𝐞𝐧𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐚 𝐮𝐧𝐢𝐪𝐮𝐞 𝐟𝐫𝐞𝐪𝐮𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐲.
The output is amplified and fed to a speaker/buzzer to produce distinct alert tones for each emergency.


## Applications
- Military emergency signaling
- Soldier distress alert
- Disaster zone survivor signaling
- Defense training demonstrations

## Future Enhancements
- Directional RF signaling
- Multi-frequency identification
- Solar-assisted power supply

## This project was developed as a **group project**.
